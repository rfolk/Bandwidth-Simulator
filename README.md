                       Bandwidth Fulfillment Simulator
                       ===============================

This simulator assumes that there is a 1 Mbps link that grants users a 100 Kbps
connection when they are active. The service has 35 subscribers with only 10%
being active (on average) at one time. This simulator will calculate the
probability that more than 10 users will attempt to utilize the service at one
time and thus experience connection issues.
